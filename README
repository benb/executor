Simple thread pool for Ruby. Not well tested, but seems to work. Released under the "MIT" license


example script, using 10 threads to print out numbers from 1..100 alongside the thread's name


require "rubygems"
require "executor"

x = ExecutorService.new(10)
(1..100).each{|i| x.submit(i){|j| puts Thread.current.to_s  + " " + j.to_s}}
x.join
